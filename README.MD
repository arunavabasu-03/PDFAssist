# PDF Chat AI with Langchain, Python, and Streamlist

This project is an AI-driven application that allows you to upload a PDF document and engage in a chat conversation with the contents of that PDF. It leverages the power of Langchain, Python, and Streamlist to create a seamless and interactive PDF chat experience. Additionally, it utilizes state-of-the-art language models, including GPT 3.5 Turbo, LLama2, and Flan 5XXL, to provide intelligent responses and meaningful interactions.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Easily upload a PDF document of your choice.
- **Chat Interface:** Engage in a chat conversation with the contents of the PDF.
- **Intelligent Responses:** The application uses advanced language models to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Multimodal AI:** Combines the capabilities of GPT 3.5 Turbo, LLama2, and Flan 5XXL for a rich conversational experience.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Streamlist enables dynamic and interactive display of PDF content.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application:** Start the application.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the PDF Chat AI.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF:** Click the "Upload PDF" button to select and upload a PDF document.
2. **Start a Conversation:** After uploading, the AI will extract the content from the PDF, and you can start a chat conversation by typing a message.
3. **AI Responses:** The AI, powered by GPT 3.5 Turbo, LLama2, and Flan 5XXL, will provide intelligent responses based on the content of the PDF.
4. **Interactive Visualization:** The chat conversation and PDF content will be displayed dynamically using Streamlist, enhancing the user experience.
